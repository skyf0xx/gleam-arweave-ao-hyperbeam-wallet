# Gleam

A Chrome MV3 browser-extension wallet for Arweave and AO. It has a
password-protected key vault, AR and AO token balances, send/receive, a
merged activity feed, tagged Arweave uploads, and an ArConnect-compatible
`window.arweaveWallet` provider. Every dApp signing request opens its own
approval window with a decoded preview.

If you are running a community security scan, `security/scan/SKILL.md` is
your whole task and the only instructions you need. The rest of this file
is for contributors.

Visual design rules are in `DESIGN.md`. The community scans design is in
`SCANS.md`.

## Stack

TypeScript, pnpm workspaces, WXT (MV3), React 19, Tailwind 4, shadcn/Radix
primitives, `@tanstack/react-query`, `@webext-core/messaging`, Vitest
(jsdom), `arweave-js`, `@dha-team/arbundles` (web build).

## Layout

- `packages/core`: pure domain logic. `signer/` (vault envelope, key
  import and signing, keyring; reached only through `@gleam/core/signer`
  and allowed no npm imports but `hash-wasm`), `vault/` and `keys/`
  (signing pipelines, JWK), `arweave/` (AR balance, transfer, GraphQL, upload), `ao/` (AO
  balance, transfer, result), `activity/`, `pricing/`, `policy/`, and
  `models/`. `ports/` holds the interfaces for storage, runtime and
  windows.
- `packages/messaging`: the typed `ProtocolMap` wire contracts between
  popup, background, content script and page.
- `packages/runtime`: `createRuntime(platform)`, the dispatcher
  (`dispatch/`) and every handler (`handlers/`) such as `wallet-lifecycle`,
  `reads`, `transfer`, `upload`, `approval` and `key-session`. It reaches
  a platform only through `Platform` (`platform.ts`).
- `packages/ui`: design tokens, primitives and shared components.
- `packages/app`: every screen (`src/screens/<screen>/`), the router
  (`src/App.tsx`) and the approval UI (`src/approval/`). It reaches a host
  only through `AppPlatform` (`src/app-platform/`), so any shell can mount
  it.
- `packages/provider`: the page-world `window.arweaveWallet` script
  (`GleamProvider`, `window.gleam`, the other-wallet router and the
  `window.permawebConnect` shim). It reaches the wallet only through
  `ProviderTransport` (`src/transport.ts`); `createWindowMessageTransport`
  is the extension's `postMessage` half of the content-script relay.
- `packages/keystone`: Keystone over QR for both shells: UR assembly,
  account decode, sign request, the camera `QrScanner`, `AnimatedQr`,
  `KeystoneConnectView` and `createKeystonePanel`. A shell hands the view
  and panel to `@gleam/app` through `AppPlatform.hardwareWallets`, because
  `app` may not import `@keystonehq` or `@ngraveio`.
- `apps/extension`: the WXT shell. `entrypoints/` holds `background`,
  `content`, `provider` (builds `provider.js` from `@gleam/provider`),
  `approval`, `passkey`, `sidepanel`, `popup` and `connect`; the popup,
  side panel and approval entrypoints only mount `@gleam/app`.
  `src/adapters/` implements the core and runtime ports and `AppPlatform`
  (`adapters/app-platform.ts`) on `chrome.*`; `src/hardware/` holds the
  Ledger transport and panel and opens the connect page in a tab.
- `apps/mobile`: the Capacitor shell for iOS and Android (Vite + React,
  `ios/` and `android/` native projects). `src/main.tsx` mounts
  `@gleam/app` with `layout="phone"` and the shell's `AppPlatform`
  (`src/app-platform.ts`). It loads only its bundled `dist/`: no
  `server.url` and no live-update plugin (`capacitor.config.mobile.test.ts`).
- `apps/points-api`: the Gleam Points server (Hono, Postgres, runs with
  `tsx` on Railway).
- `scripts/scan/`: the `pnpm scan start|finish` CLI that scan agents run
  (spec in `SCANS.md`).

## Patterns

- **Hexagonal.** `core` never imports `chrome.*`, WXT or an adapter. Pass
  network access in (`fetchImpl`, URLs) and storage through `StoragePort`.
  `runtime` is held to the same rule (no `chrome`/`browser`, `wxt/*`,
  `@webext-core/*`, `@capacitor/*` or shell imports; ESLint enforces it).
  The background entrypoint builds a `Platform` from the adapters and
  hands it to `createRuntime`. `app` follows the same fence: screens
  reach the host through `AppPlatform` (runtime client, permissions,
  downloads, hardware wallets, passkey window), and the shell mounts
  `<PlatformProvider platform={…}>` around `<App>`. `provider` has the
  same fence and also may not import `@gleam/core`, `runtime`, `app`,
  `ui`, or anything from `@gleam/messaging` but `page-protocol.ts`: it
  runs in the page, and a transport never puts an origin in a request.
- **UI never imports background code.** Every cross-context call goes
  through `packages/messaging`. `packages/runtime/src/dispatch/methods.ts` is the one table
  of each method's caller tier, whether it can open an approval, and the
  zod schema its page-supplied params are parsed with; the background
  dispatcher enforces it before any handler runs.
- **Signing keys** are decrypted on unlock and held in
  `chrome.storage.session` through `handlers/key-session.ts`, keyed by
  wallet id. Handlers get the key from there. Never re-derive it from a
  password.
- **Passkey unlock** wraps the vault password under the passkey's
  WebAuthn PRF output (`core/vault/passkey.ts`, `handlers/passkey.ts`),
  so it unlocks exactly like the password. The RP id is the extension
  id. The action popup closes when the browser's passkey prompt takes
  focus, so from the popup every ceremony runs in the `passkey.html`
  window (`src/passkey/open-window.ts`); the side panel and approval
  window run it inline.
- **AO sends** are ANS-104 items built and signed with plain WebCrypto in
  `core/ao/transfer.ts`, then POSTed to `mu.ao-testnet.xyz`. Don't use
  `@permaweb/aoconnect`: its browser build's signature check breaks raw-JWK
  signing in Chrome. Outcomes are read from `cu.ao-testnet.xyz/result/…`
  (`core/ao/result.ts`).
- **Amounts** are atomic-integer strings (Winston, or the token's smallest
  unit). Never floats.
- **Activity** merges the local optimistic log with gateway GraphQL. A
  background alarm settles pending entries every minute.
- **Tests** sit next to the file they test (`foo.ts` → `foo.*.test.ts`).
  Mock the network with a stubbed `fetch`. Mock a whole module only at a
  package boundary.
- **Announcements** for the main-screen notice card live in
  `apps/site/announcements.json`: `[{ id, level: "info" | "critical",
  title?, text, url? }]`. They go live when the site deploys, and popups pick
  them up within an hour. Dismissals are stored by `id`, so a changed
  notice needs a new `id`. A `url` must be https on the Gleam site or
  `x.com` (`handlers/announcements.ts`), or the entry is dropped.
- **Comments** explain the non-obvious *why*. Don't narrate the change
  that produced the code.

## Build and check

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev                                   # WXT dev build with live reload
pnpm wxt:build                             # production build → apps/extension/.output/chrome-mv3
pnpm mobile:build                          # app web bundle → apps/mobile/dist (mobile:ios / mobile:android sync and open the native project)
pnpm vitest run [path-fragment]            # tests
pnpm tsc -p packages/core --noEmit         # also: packages/messaging, packages/ui, packages/runtime, packages/app, packages/provider, packages/keystone, apps/extension, apps/mobile, apps/points-api, scripts/scan
pnpm eslint --max-warnings=0 <files>
```

The pre-commit hook (lefthook) runs eslint on staged files and tsc on all
eleven projects. A change is done when tests, tsc, eslint, `pnpm wxt:build`
and `pnpm mobile:build` pass. If a change touches signing, network or
extension wiring, it also needs a manual check in Chrome (load
`.output/chrome-mv3` unpacked).

## Workflow

Make one Conventional Commit per change (`fix(ao): …`,
`feat(activity): …`), group related commits on one branch, open one PR
for the branch, and merge it once CI is green. `master` accepts only
signed commits through a PR with passing CI, and admins get no bypass.
This repo signs commits with an SSH key (`git config --local
commit.gpgsign true`), so the key has to be loaded in `ssh-agent`.
